# BLDAP_notebooks
Teaching Notebooks used for the Director's Apprenticeship Program at Berkley National Labs (any use of student names have been changed).
While most of these notebooks can be used for standalone use, they were used in a classroom setting where students could ask questions or work together, and there are occasional instructions to work as a group.

I was the fourth in a line of instructors who iterated on these notebooks, so the choice of content is not my own and a few of the examples are not mine and problems, but I did make significant changes to the explanations and the problems. The goal of my edits was to make the notebooks more relatable to the user. 

My additions are not limited but include: 
-Improved the instructions. Any instructions with color-coded were added by me. 
-The addition of all "Good Coding Practice Moments"
-Any mentions of "the game" (see note below)

The Game
Know that many of the students would struggle with understanding the purpose of later topics such as functions and loops, I started the unit with an in person game. The instructions of are included in the PDF "Intro to coding activity.pdf". The basic idea is that a team of students has to direct one member of the team through a maze, pick up a ping-pong ball, and bring the member back. The trick is that the team is limited to 6 possible commands i.e. they can say turn right, but there is no turn left option.
